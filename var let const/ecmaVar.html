    <h2> ARROW FUNCTION in JavaScript</h2>
    <p> An arrow function in JavaScript is a concise way to write anonymous
         functions. Arrow functions were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and
          provide a more concise syntax compared to traditional function 
          expressions. They are especially useful for short, one-line functions.</p>
